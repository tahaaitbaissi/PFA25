# Project Setup Guide

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Start OpenSearch

Make sure Docker is running, then from the project root:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start OpenSearch in detached mode. You can check if itâ€™s running with:

```bash
docker ps
```

---

### 2. Start the AI Service

In a new terminal (PowerShell or command prompt):

```bash
cd ai_model
.venv\Scripts\activate
python main.py
```

---

### 3. Start the Backend Service

In another new terminal:

```bash
cd backend
.venv\Scripts\activate
python run.py
```

---

### ðŸ§¾ Logs

- Both the **AI service** and the **backend** will print logs directly in the terminals where you launched them.
- To view OpenSearch logs, use:

```bash
docker logs -f <container_id_or_name>
```

You can get the container name using:

```bash
docker ps
```
